# wage_inflation_calculator
A [website](https://ucg8j.shinyapps.io/wage_inflation_calculator/) to view the effect of inflation on wages in Australia. Built using R and shiny.

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)
The Consumer Price Index was sourced from the [RBA](http://www.rba.gov.au/inflation/measures-cpi.html). The projected CPI was sourced from the [Treasury's Economic Outlook.](http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2016/PEFO-2016/HTML/Economic-outlook)

Since Treasury published CPI in the format of '1 1/2' instead of a machine readable '1.5' I ended up 
manually adding the projected figures to the rates table.
